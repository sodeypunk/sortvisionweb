                    With the increasing number of sporting events and millions of photos captured every year, it is vital for sporting industries to meet the need of on-demand photos. SortVISION uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Machine Learning which accurately detect a broad set of bibs. Our software, BibSmart â„¢ uses three key factors: identify, detect, and analyze to provide accurate results on millions of images at a higher speed than manual tagging. The goal of the software is to reduce your dependency on human capital as well as unlikely human error.
